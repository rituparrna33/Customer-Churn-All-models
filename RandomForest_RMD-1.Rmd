```

## First Steps 

NOTE: Your data needs to be in the folder where your code is located!

The first Chunk of Code will always do 3 Things for us

1) Clear ALL Variables (to make sure nothing is "left over") and clear the      screen. 
2) Read in the data we want to use. In our case the file is called              "Data_Churn_R.csv"
3) Explore the data (what variables are in it and what are some basic           statistics for these variables)

```{r}

# Clear All Variables & Clear Screen
rm(list=ls())
cat("\014")

# Read in the Data
data.churn = read.csv("Data_Churn_R.csv")

# Explore the data
str(data.churn)
summary(data.churn)
```


## Install rpart Package and "open" it (call the library)
Type "?rpart" for more information on the rpart library

```{r}

#install.packages('randomForest')
library(randomForest)
```


## Training and Test Data 

1) Need to Create Training Data (i.e., Estimation Data) and Test Data (i.e., Holdout Data). The data has 2,000 observations. use the first 1,000 for training

```{r}

data.train <- data.churn[1:1000,]
data.test  <- data.churn[1001:2000,]
```

## Classification RandomForest

Step 1: Estimate the RandomForest model  

```{r}

# If you want a classification model (here 0/1) the y data needs to be saved
# as a factor)
data.train$y <- as.factor(data.train$y)

rf.model <- randomForest(y ~ ., data= data.train, ntree=5000, mtry=3)

# Display the results 
plot(rf.model, type="l", main="Error as RF grows")

```

Step 2: Predict Churn behavior with the RandomForest

```{r}
# Predicted Probabilities
rf.prediction.props <- predict(rf.model,data.test,type = c("class"), predict.all=FALSE)

# Predicted Class (Churn vs. non-churn)
rf.prediction.class <- predict(rf.model,data.test,type = c("class"), predict.all=FALSE)
```

Step 3: Create Confusion Matrix allowing to judge the quality of the predictions

```{r}
# You should have already installed the package "gmodels" in our Intro_R code
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(rf.prediction.class,data.test[,1],prop.r=FALSE, prop.c=FALSE,prop.t=FALSE,
           prop.chisq=FALSE,dnn = c("Predict", "Actual"))
```
