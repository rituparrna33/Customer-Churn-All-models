```

## First Steps 

NOTE: Your data needs to be in the folder where your code is located!

The first Chunk of Code will always do 3 Things for us

1) Clear ALL Variables (to make sure nothing is "left over") and clear the      screen. 
2) Read in the data we want to use. In our case the file is called              "Data_Churn_R.csv"
3) Explore the data (what variables are in it and what are some basic           statistics for these variables)

```{r cars}

# Clear All Variables & Clear the Screen
rm(list=ls())
cat("\014")

# Read in the Data
data.churn = read.csv("Data_Churn_R.csv")

# Explore the data
str(data.churn)
summary(data.churn)
```

## Install Neural Network Package and "open" it (call the library)
Type "?neuralnet" for more information on the neuralnet library

```{r}

#install.packages('neuralnet')
library("neuralnet")
```


## Training and Test Data 

1) Need to Create Training Data (i.e., Estimation Data) and Test Data (i.e., Holdout Data). The data has 2,000 observations. use the first 1,000 for training

```{r}

data.train <- data.churn[1:1000,]
data.test  <- data.churn[1001:2000,]
```


## NEURAL NET MODEL 

We will run our model on the ESTIMATION Data (i.e, using the FIRST 200 IDs)

1) Define y (Dependent Variable). For this example, y (a consumer either churns or not) is used

2) Define X (Independent Variables). For this example, lp1, lp2, lp3, and lp4 are used (see class slides for how we caculated these)

3) Train the neural network. Need to input three values: i) Number of hidden layers (e.g., I am using 10 hidden layers below), ii) Threshold is a numeric value specifying the threshold stopping criteria (e.g., using 0.01), and iii) Stepmax gives the stepsize for the algorithm (e.g., using 1e6)

```{r}

# Estimate the Neural Net
nn.model <- neuralnet(y~lp1+lp2+lp3+lp4,data.train, hidden=20, threshold=0.01,stepmax=1e6)

# Lets see what properties neuralnet.fit has
summary(nn.model)
 
#Plot the neural network
plot(nn.model)

```

Step 2: Predict Churn behavior with the Neural Network

```{r}
# Predicted Probabilities
nn.prediction.props <- compute(nn.model,data.test[,2:length(data.test)])


# Predicted Class (Churn vs. non-churn)
glm.prediction.class <- round(nn.prediction.props$net.result)

```

Step 3: Create Confusion Matrix allowing to judge the quality of the predictions

```{r}
# You should have already installed the package "gmodels" in our Intro_R code
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(glm.prediction.class,data.test[,1],prop.r=FALSE, prop.c=FALSE,prop.t=FALSE,
           prop.chisq=FALSE,dnn = c("Predict", "Actual"))
```
